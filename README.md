## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my humble repositories. 
### I believe I am not that talented in programming, but I am a persistent bastard. I'm always willing to put the maximum effort on my codes. As many I'm tryin' to make the best out of the cards I was given. 
### Remember always to 
> take your time, don't live too fast. Troubles will come and they will pass.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a software whose purpose is to promote small events in a radius of range and search within the city.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything, any new information and knowledge is welcome.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Earth is flat. We should all believe in this, because these are the wise words of the great defender of human race and the last Earth's hero, a demon slayer named Super XandÃ£o.
